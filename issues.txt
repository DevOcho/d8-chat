Current issues with the slack_clone:

New messages in #general are showing up with the mention badge even though users aren't mentioned.

We can't send HTML in code blocks because it is scrubbed out.  We need to make the HTML escaped instead of removing it.

Search for messages.

We need to be able to upload files and have avatars and inline images.

We need a way to search and add gifs

I also think we are going to need to implement threads but I only want them in channels.

Group DMs (talk with more than one person) and also the ability to promote a group conversation to a channel.

If the last admin leaves a channel and there are no other admins then we need to require the elect an admin before they leave.

We need to be able to archive a channel to some fun archive spot that is still searchable but not active (can't message but you can see the messages if you were in the channel when it was archived).

I want the side bar to only show a max number of people on the side nav.  Let's say we have 10,000 users in the chat.  We only want to show people we've initiated a DM with or that have initiated a DM with us. We also don't want to show more than ~20 people total.

Add Bots and webhooks

We need a help screen or perhaps a full docs setup for the options in the chat.

We need to drastically improve the README

"Hey, there hasn't been any traffic in "4Q25 Reporting" is X days. What me to remove that from showing up in your Sidebar?" Ideally I would be able set that cull date, or have Autocull options.
