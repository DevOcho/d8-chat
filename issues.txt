Current issues with the slack_clone:

Kenny: The "is typing" indicator should only appear when you are in the same channel or dm as the person is typing in.  It also might get stuck if you switch channels when they are typing. It's the second one.

Kate: @ button on the bottom doesn't work
We also need to be able to @channel and @here

Kate: If you type something and then try to click the Aa button or reply to someone the text you typed disappears

Ambar: When you go to your profile, you appear offline

Kate: If someone else is typing the emoji thing moves

Kate: mentions are not working

Natalie: pasting doesn't work

Sagrario: She doesn't like that Hash tags are being formatted as headers in markdown

The new indicator needs to move if I read the message and then the window looses focus and then I come back to it.  This might not be possible but it would be nice.

Enable notifications doesn't seem to be showing up for everyone.

We need to be able to upload files and have avatars and inline images.

We need a way to search and add gifs

I also think we are going to need to implement threads but I only want them in channels.

Group DMs (talk with more than one person) and also the ability to promote a group conversation to a channel.

We need to be able to archive a channel to some fun archive spot that is still searchable but not active (can't message but you can see the messages if you were in the channel when it was archived).

I want the side bar to only show a max number of people on the side nav.  Let's say we have 10,000 users in the chat.  We only want to show people we've initiated a DM with or that have initiated a DM with us. We also don't want to show more than ~20 people total.

We need to create a full administration section
  - Users Management
  - Channel Management
  - Audit Log (feature that logs all chats and channel changes)

Robert: you can only type one emoji at a time

There is a full page refresh when you leave a channel.  This should probably be an OOB to update things
instead but it was causing issues and it's 10pm and I want this to work.  So I'm risking someone sending
you a message at the exact same second you click the leave button (websocket disconnects).  That message will
be missed until you reload the browser.

Add Bots and webhooks

We need a help screen or perhaps a full docs setup for the options in the chat.

We need to drastically improve the README

"Hey, there hasn't been any traffic in "4Q25 Reporting" is X days. What me to remove that from showing up in your Sidebar?" Ideally I would be able set that cull date, or have Autocull options.
