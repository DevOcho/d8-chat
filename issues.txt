Current issues with the slack_clone:

Testing Party
  - When you @mention someone you should highilght their name as a link to a DM with them
  - Something strange is happening when people send a message in the channel and you are
    watching it.  It will still go bold for you and then switch back and forth.
  - Empty topics show "None".  Should be a nicer message.
  - Single emoji should be larger (like whatsapp)
  - Profile panel opens on the other side of the screen.
  - code fencing not working
  - There is an issue with the new message indicator in the channels (maybe other places). after a refresh it seems to start showing up but not before a refresh.

Style bug when you start a new chat with a user (the avatars are squished together)

Small extra box on the top of the chat inputs that exist solely for image uploads.  These shouldn't be visible until someone actually uploads an image.

Natalie: pasting doesn't work

Sagrario: She doesn't like that Hash tags are being formatted as headers in markdown

We need to be able to upload files.

We need a way to search and add gifs

We need to update the administration section with HTMX and set it up to handle more users.
  - Users Management
  - Channel Management
  - Audit Log (feature that logs all chats and channel changes)

i18n

If the server disconnects, it will reconnect for users at different times.  Messages sent while the other user is reconnecting are lost until a page refresh when they will show up for a user.  On the reconnect we probably need to reload the messages or do a full page refresh.

We need to develop an audit log for all chats so we can see if someone does something inappropriate and/or illegal.

We need to be able to archive a channel to some fun archive spot that is still searchable but not active (can't message but you can see the messages if you were in the channel when it was archived).

I want to add "Direct Messages", and "Mentions & Reactions" to the Activity area on the quick view.

I'd love the chat input to turn into a file upload drop location when someone hovers an image over the chat window.

Group DMs (talk with more than one person) and also the ability to promote a group conversation to a channel.

We need to be able to archive a channel to some fun archive spot that is still searchable but not active (can't message but you can see the messages if you were in the channel when it was archived).

Set a work hours time and change the status icon to indicate if it's within our outside of their work hours.  The work hours can be set in the profile (for example, 8am to 5pm).

The new indicator needs to move if I read the message and then the window looses focus and then I come back to it.  This might not be possible but it would be nice.

Hashtags as searchable keywords in messages.

Robert: you can only type one emoji at a time

There is a full page refresh when you leave a channel.  This should probably be an OOB to update things
instead but it was causing issues and it's 10pm and I want this to work.  So I'm risking someone sending
you a message at the exact same second you click the leave button (websocket disconnects).  That message will
be missed until you reload the browser.

Add Bots and webhooks

We need a help screen or perhaps a full docs setup for the options in the chat.

We need to drastically improve the README

"Hey, there hasn't been any traffic in "4Q25 Reporting" is X days. What me to remove that from showing up in your Sidebar?" Ideally I would be able set that cull date, or have Autocull options.
