Current issues with the slack_clone:

I also think we are going to need to implement threads but I only want them in channels.  I like the WhatsApp reply feature more than threads so maybe that's a better overall experience in Direct messages.

I want the side bar to only show a max number of people on the side nav.  Let's say we have 10,000 users in the chat.  We only want to show people we've initiated a DM with or that have initiated a DM with us.

We need a dark mode.

We need to improve the profile screen

we need to imporove the landing page

I want to add the @ feature for channels, where the message is highlighted (where you were @'d) and the only unread messages counts for channels will be where you were @'d.  Otherwise it will just bold them as having messages that you haven't read but it won't actually show the red badge (unless you've been @'d in the channel).
