Current issues with the slack_clone:

Can't reply to other people's messages.  Only to your own.

We can't send HTML in code blocks because it is scrubbed out.  We need to make the HTML escaped instead of removing it.

We need to make links clickable

Reactions to messages would be nice.

I also think we are going to need to implement threads but I only want them in channels.

I want the side bar to only show a max number of people on the side nav.  Let's say we have 10,000 users in the chat.  We only want to show people we've initiated a DM with or that have initiated a DM with us. We also don't want to show more than ~20 people total.

I want to add the @ feature for channels, where the message is highlighted (where you were @'d) and the only unread messages counts for channels will be where you were @'d.  Otherwise it will just bold them as having messages that you haven't read but it won't actually show the red badge (unless you've been @'d in the channel).

We need to be able to upload files

We need a way to search and add gifs

---

We need a help screen or perhaps a full docs setup for the options in the chat.

We need to drastically improve the README

"Hey, there hasn't been any traffic in "4Q25 Reporting" is X days. What me to remove that from showing up in your Sidebar?" Ideally I would be able set that cull date, or have Autocull options.

Group DMs (talk with more than one person) and also the ability to promote a group conversation to a channel.

Add Bots and webhooks
