Current issues with the slack_clone:

We can't send HTML in code blocks because it is scrubbed out.  We need to make the HTML escaped instead of removing it.

Reactions to messages would be nice.

Search for messages.

If the last admin leaves a channel and there are no other admins then we need to require the elect an admin before they leave.

We need to be able to archive a channel to some fun archive spot that is still searchable but not active (can't message but you can see the messages if you were in the channel when it was archived).

I also think we are going to need to implement threads but I only want them in channels.

I want the side bar to only show a max number of people on the side nav.  Let's say we have 10,000 users in the chat.  We only want to show people we've initiated a DM with or that have initiated a DM with us. We also don't want to show more than ~20 people total.

We need to be able to upload files and have avatars and inline images.

We need a way to search and add gifs

---

We need a help screen or perhaps a full docs setup for the options in the chat.

We need to drastically improve the README

"Hey, there hasn't been any traffic in "4Q25 Reporting" is X days. What me to remove that from showing up in your Sidebar?" Ideally I would be able set that cull date, or have Autocull options.

Group DMs (talk with more than one person) and also the ability to promote a group conversation to a channel.

Add Bots and webhooks
